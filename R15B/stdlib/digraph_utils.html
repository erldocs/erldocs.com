  <h2 class="modsummary">Algorithms for Directed Graphs</h2>
  <div class="description">
    <p>The <code>digraph_utils</code> module implements some algorithms
      based on depth-first traversal of directed graphs. See the
      <code>digraph</code> module for basic functions on directed graphs.
      </p>
    <p>A <span id="digraph"> </span><em>directed graph</em> (or 
       just "digraph") is a pair (V,&nbsp;E) of a finite set V of
       <span id="vertex"> </span><em>vertices</em> and a finite set E 
       of <span id="edge"> </span><em>directed edges</em> (or just 
       "edges"). The set of edges E is a subset of V&nbsp;×&nbsp;V 
       (the Cartesian product of V with itself).
      </p>
    <p>Digraphs can be annotated with additional information. Such
      information may be attached to the vertices and to the edges of
      the digraph. A digraph which has been annotated is called a
      <em>labeled digraph</em>, and the information attached to a
      vertex or an edge is called a <span id="label"> </span>
      <em>label</em>.</p>
    <p>An edge e&nbsp;=&nbsp;(v,&nbsp;w) is said 
      to <span id="emanate"> </span><em>emanate</em> from vertex v and 
      to be <span id="incident"> </span><em>incident</em> on vertex w. 
      If there is an edge emanating from v and incident on w, then w is 
      said to be 
      an <span id="out_neighbour"> </span><em>out-neighbour</em> of v, 
      and v is said to be 
      an <span id="in_neighbour"> </span><em>in-neighbour</em> of w. 
      A <span id="path"> </span><em>path</em> P from v[1] to v[k] in a 
      digraph (V,&nbsp;E) is a non-empty sequence
      v[1],&nbsp;v[2],&nbsp;...,&nbsp;v[k] of vertices in V such that
      there is an edge (v[i],v[i+1]) in E for
      1&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;k. 
      The <span id="length"> </span><em>length</em> of the path P is k-1. 
      P is a <span id="cycle"> </span><em>cycle</em> if the length of P 
      is not zero and v[1] = v[k]. 
      A <span id="loop"> </span><em>loop</em> is a cycle of length one. 
      An <span id="acyclic_digraph"> </span><em>acyclic digraph</em> is 
      a digraph that has no cycles.
      </p>

    <p>A <span id="depth_first_traversal"> </span> <em>depth-first
      traversal</em> of a directed digraph can be viewed as a process
      that visits all vertices of the digraph. Initially, all vertices
      are marked as unvisited. The traversal starts with an
      arbitrarily chosen vertex, which is marked as visited, and
      follows an edge to an unmarked vertex, marking that vertex. The
      search then proceeds from that vertex in the same fashion, until
      there is no edge leading to an unvisited vertex. At that point
      the process backtracks, and the traversal continues as long as
      there are unexamined edges. If there remain unvisited vertices
      when all edges from the first vertex have been examined, some
      hitherto unvisited vertex is chosen, and the process is
      repeated.
      </p>
    <p>A <span id="partial_ordering"> </span><em>partial ordering</em> of 
      a set S is a transitive, antisymmetric and reflexive relation
      between the objects of S. The problem 
      of <span id="topsort"> </span><em>topological sorting</em> is to 
      find a total
      ordering of S that is a superset of the partial ordering. A
      digraph G&nbsp;=&nbsp;(V,&nbsp;E) is equivalent to a relation E
      on V (we neglect the fact that the version of directed graphs
      implemented in the <code>digraph</code> module allows multiple edges
      between vertices). If the digraph has no cycles of length two or
      more, then the reflexive and transitive closure of E is a
      partial ordering.
      </p>
    <p>A <span id="subgraph"> </span><em>subgraph</em> G' of G is a
      digraph whose vertices and edges form subsets of the vertices
      and edges of G. G' is <em>maximal</em> with respect to a
      property P if all other subgraphs that include the vertices of
      G' do not have the property P. A <span id="strong_components"> </span> <em>strongly connected
      component</em> is a maximal subgraph such that there is a path
      between each pair of vertices. A <span id="components"> </span><em>connected component</em> is a
      maximal subgraph such that there is a path between each pair of
      vertices, considering all edges undirected. An <span id="arborescence"> </span><em>arborescence</em> is an acyclic
      digraph with a vertex V, the <span id="root"> </span><em>root</em>, such that there is a unique
      path from V to every other vertex of G. A <span id="tree"> </span><em>tree</em> is an acyclic non-empty digraph
      such that there is a unique path between every pair of vertices,
      considering all edges undirected.</p>
