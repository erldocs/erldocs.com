  <libsummary>API functions for an Erlang driver.</libsummary>
  <div class="description">
    <p>An Erlang driver is a library containing a set of native driver
      callback functions that the Erlang Virtual Machine calls when certain
      events occur. There can be multiple instances of a driver, each
      instance is associated with an Erlang port.</p>

    <span id="WARNING"> </span>
    <div class="warning"><h2>Warning!</h2>
      <p><em>Use this functionality with extreme care.</em></p>
      <p>A driver callback is executed as a direct extension of the
        native code of the VM. Execution is not made in a safe environment.
        The VM <em>cannot</em> provide the same services as provided when
        executing Erlang code, such as pre-emptive scheduling or memory
        protection. If the driver callback function does not behave well,
        the whole VM will misbehave.</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>
          <p>A driver callback that crash will crash the whole VM.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>An erroneously implemented driver callback can cause a VM
            internal state inconsistency, which can cause a crash of the VM,
            or miscellaneous misbehaviors of the VM at any point after the
            call to the driver callback.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>A driver callback doing
            <a href="#lengthy_work" class="seealso">lengthy work</a> before
            returning degrades responsiveness of the VM and can cause
            miscellaneous strange behaviors. Such strange behaviors
            include, but are not limited to, extreme memory usage and bad
            load balancing between schedulers. Strange behaviors that can
            occur because of lengthy work can also vary between Erlang/OTP
            releases.</p>
        </item>
      </list>
    </div>

    <p>As from ERTS 5.5.3 the driver interface has been extended
      (see <a href="driver_entry.html#extended_marker" class="seealso">
      <code>extended marker</code></a>). The extended interface introduces
      <a href="#version_management" class="seealso">version management</a>,
      the possibility to pass capability flags (see
      <a href="driver_entry.html#driver_flags" class="seealso">
      <code>driver_flags</code></a>) to the runtime system at driver
      initialization, and some new driver API functions.</p>

    <div class="note"><h2>Note!</h2>
      <p>As from ERTS 5.9 old drivers must be recompiled
        and use the extended interface. They must also be adjusted to the
        <a href="#rewrites_for_64_bits" class="seealso">
        64-bit capable driver interface</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The driver calls back to the emulator, using the API
      functions declared in <code>erl_driver.h</code>. They are used for
      outputting data from the driver, using timers, and so on.</p>

    <p>Each driver instance is associated with a port. Every port
      has a port owner process. Communication with the port is normally
      done through the port owner process. Most of the functions take
      the <code>port</code> handle as an argument. This identifies the driver
      instance. Notice that this port handle must be stored by the driver,
      it is not given when the driver is called from the emulator (see
      <a href="driver_entry.html#emulator" class="seealso">
      <code>driver_entry</code></a>).</p>

    <p>Some of the functions take a parameter of type
      <code>ErlDrvBinary</code>, a driver binary. It is to be both
      allocated and freed by the caller. Using a binary directly avoids
      one extra copying of data.</p>

    <p>Many of the output functions have a "header buffer", with
      <code>hbuf</code> and <code>hlen</code> parameters. This buffer is sent as a
      list before the binary (or list, depending on port mode) that is
      sent. This is convenient when matching on messages received from
      the port. (Although in the latest Erlang versions there is
      the binary syntax, which enables you to match on the beginning of
      a binary.)</p>
    <p><span id="smp_support"> </span>In the runtime system with
      SMP support, drivers are locked either on driver level
      or port level (driver instance level). By default
      driver level locking will be used, that is, only one emulator thread
      will execute code in the driver at a time. If port level locking
      is used, multiple emulator threads can execute code in the driver
      at the same time. Only one thread at a time will call
      driver callbacks corresponding to the same port, though.
      To enable port level locking, set the <code>ERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING</code>
      <a href="driver_entry.html#driver_flags" class="seealso">driver flag</a> in
      the <a href="driver_entry.html" class="seealso"><code>driver_entry</code></a>
      used by the driver. When port level locking is used,
      the driver writer is responsible for synchronizing all accesses
      to data shared by the ports (driver instances).</p>

    <p>Most drivers written before the runtime system with SMP
      support existed can run in the runtime system
      with SMP support, without being rewritten, if driver
      level locking is used.</p>

    <div class="note"><h2>Note!</h2>
      <p>It is assumed that drivers do not access other drivers. If
        drivers access each other, they must provide their own
        mechanism for thread-safe synchronization. Such "inter-driver
        communication" is strongly discouraged.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Previously, in the runtime system without SMP support,
      specific driver callbacks were always called from the same
      thread. This is <em>not</em> the case in the runtime system
      with SMP support. Regardless of locking scheme used, calls
      to driver callbacks can be made from different threads. For example,
      two consecutive calls to exactly the same callback for exactly
      the same port can be made from two different threads. This
      is for <em>most</em> drivers not a problem, but it can be.
      Drivers that depend on all callbacks that are called in the
      same thread, <em>must</em> be rewritten before they are used
      in the runtime system with SMP support.</p>

    <div class="note"><h2>Note!</h2>
      <p>Regardless of locking scheme used, calls to driver
        callbacks can be made from different threads.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Most functions in this API are <em>not</em> thread-safe, that is,
      they <em>cannot</em> be called from arbitrary threads. Functions
      that are not documented as thread-safe can only be called from
      driver callbacks or function calls descending from a driver
      callback call. Notice that driver callbacks can be called from
      different threads. This, however, is not a problem for any
      function in this API, as the emulator has control over
      these threads.</p>

    <div class="warning"><h2>Warning!</h2>
      <p>Functions not explicitly documented as thread-safe are
        <em>not</em> thread safe. Also notice that some functions
        are <em>only</em> thread-safe when used in a runtime
        system with SMP support.</p>
      <p>A function not explicitly documented as thread-safe can, at
        some point in time, have a thread-safe implementation in the
        runtime system. Such an implementation can however change to
        a thread <em>unsafe</em> implementation at any time <em>without
        any notice</em>.</p>
      <p><em>Only use functions explicitly documented as thread-safe
        from arbitrary threads.</em></p>
    </div>

    <p><span id="lengthy_work"> </span>
      As mentioned in the <a href="#WARNING" class="seealso">warning</a> text at
      the beginning of this section, it is of vital importance that a driver
      callback returns relatively fast. It is difficult to give an exact
      maximum amount of time that a driver callback is allowed to work, but
      usually a well-behaving driver callback is to return within 1 millisecond.
      This can be achieved using different approaches.
      If you have full control over the code to execute in the driver
      callback, the best approach is to divide the work into multiple chunks of
      work, and trigger multiple calls to the
      <a href="driver_entry.html#timeout" class="seealso">time-out callback</a> using
      zero time-outs. Function <a href="#erl_drv_consume_timeslice" class="seealso">
      <code>erl_drv_consume_timeslice</code></a> can be useful to
      determine when to trigger such time-out callback calls. However, sometimes
      it cannot be implemented this way, for example when calling
      third-party libraries. In this case, you typically want to dispatch the
      work to another thread. Information about thread primitives is provided
      below.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h4>Functionality</h4>
    <p>All functions that a driver needs to do with Erlang are
      performed through driver API functions. Functions exist
      for the following functionality:</p>

    <taglist>
      <dt>Timer functions</dt>
      <item>
        <p>Control the timer that a driver can use. The timer has the
          emulator call the <a href="driver_entry.html#timeout" class="seealso">
          <code>timeout</code></a> entry function after a specified time.
          Only one timer is available for each driver instance.</p>
      </item>
      <dt>Queue handling</dt>
      <item>
        <p>Every driver instance has an associated queue. This queue is a
          <code>SysIOVec</code>, which works as a buffer. It is mostly used for
          the driver to buffer data that is to be written to a device,
          it is a byte stream. If the port owner process closes the
          driver, and the queue is not empty, the driver is not
          closed. This enables the driver to flush its buffers before
          closing.</p>
        <p>The queue can be manipulated from any threads if
          a port data lock is used. For more information, see
          <a href="#ErlDrvPDL" class="seealso"><code>ErlDrvPDL</code></a>.</p>
      </item>
      <dt>Output functions</dt>
      <item>
        <p>With these functions, the driver sends data back to the emulator.
          The data is received as messages by the port owner process, see
          <a href="../erlang/open_port/2.html" class="seealso">
          <code>erlang:open_port/2</code></a>. The vector function and the
          function taking a driver binary are faster, as they avoid
          copying the data buffer. There is also a fast way of sending
          terms from the driver, without going through the binary term
          format.</p></item>
      <dt>Failure</dt>
      <item>
        <p>The driver can exit and signal errors up to Erlang. This is
          only for severe errors, when the driver cannot possibly keep
          open.</p>
      </item>
      <dt>Asynchronous calls</dt>
      <item>
        <p>Erlang/OTP R7B and later versions have provision for
          asynchronous function calls, using a thread pool provided by
          Erlang. There is also a select call, which can be used for
          asynchronous drivers.</p>
      </item>
      <dt><span id="multi_threading"> </span>Multi-threading</dt>
      <item>
        <p>A POSIX thread like API for multi-threading is provided. The
          Erlang driver thread API only provides a subset of the functionality
          provided by the POSIX thread API. The subset provided is
          more or less the basic functionality needed for multi-threaded
          programming:</p>
        <list>
          <item><a href="#ErlDrvTid" class="seealso">Threads</a></item>
          <item><a href="#ErlDrvMutex" class="seealso">Mutexes</a></item>
          <item><a href="#ErlDrvCond" class="seealso">
            Condition variables</a></item>
          <item><a href="#ErlDrvRWLock" class="seealso">
            Read/write locks</a></item>
          <item><a href="#ErlDrvTSDKey" class="seealso">
           Thread-specific data</a></item>
        </list>
        <p>The Erlang driver thread API can be used in conjunction with
          the POSIX thread API on UN-ices and with the Windows native thread
          API on Windows. The Erlang driver thread API has the advantage of
          being portable, but there can exist situations where you want to
          use functionality from the POSIX thread API or the Windows
          native thread API.</p>
        <p>The Erlang driver thread API only returns error codes when it is
          reasonable to recover from an error condition. If it is not reasonable
          to recover from an error condition, the whole runtime system is
          terminated. For example, if a create mutex operation fails, an error
          code is returned, but if a lock operation on a mutex fails, the
          whole runtime system is terminated.</p>
        <p>Notice that there is no "condition variable wait with time-out" in
          the Erlang driver thread API. This because of issues with
          <code>pthread_cond_timedwait</code>. When the system clock suddenly
          is changed, it is not always guaranteed that you will wake up from
          the call as expected. An Erlang runtime system must be able to
          cope with sudden changes of the system clock. Therefore, we have
          omitted it from the Erlang driver thread API. In the Erlang driver
          case, time-outs can and are to be handled with the timer functionality
          of the Erlang driver API.</p>
        <p>In order for the Erlang driver thread API to function, thread
          support must be enabled in the runtime system. An Erlang driver
          can check if thread support is enabled by use of
          <a href="#driver_system_info" class="seealso">
          <code>driver_system_info</code></a>.
          Notice that some functions in the Erlang driver API are thread-safe
          only when the runtime system has SMP support, also this
          information can be retrieved through
          <a href="#driver_system_info" class="seealso">
          <code>driver_system_info</code></a>.
          Also notice that many functions in the Erlang driver API are
          <em>not</em> thread-safe, regardless of whether SMP support is
          enabled or not. If a function is not documented as thread-safe, it
          is <em>not</em> thread-safe.</p>
        <div class="note"><h2>Note!</h2>
          <p>When executing in an emulator thread, it is
            <em>very important</em> that you unlock <em>all</em> locks you
            have locked before letting the thread out of your control;
            otherwise you are <em>very likely</em> to deadlock the whole
            emulator.</p>
          <p>If you need to use thread-specific data in an emulator
            thread, only have the thread-specific data set while the thread is
            under your control, and clear the thread-specific data before
            you let the thread out of your control.</p>
        </div>
        <p>In the future, debug functionality will probably be
          integrated with the Erlang driver thread API. All functions
          that create entities take a <code>name</code> argument. Currently
          the <code>name</code> argument is unused, but it will be used when
          the debug functionality is implemented. If you name all
          entities created well, the debug functionality will be able
          to give you better error reports.</p>

          <a href="driver_entry.html" class="seealso"><code>driver_entry</code></a>
          to <code>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</code>. <code>erl_driver.h</code> defines:</p>
        <list type="bulleted">
          <item>
            <p><code>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER</code></p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p><code>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</code>, which is incremented when
              driver incompatible changes are made to the Erlang runtime
              system. Normally it suffices to recompile drivers when
              <code>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION</code> has changed, but it
              can, under rare circumstances, mean that drivers must
              be slightly modified. If so, this will of course be
              documented.</p>
          </item>
          <item>
            <p><code>ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION</code>, which is incremented when
              new features are added. The runtime system uses the minor version
              of the driver to determine what features to use.</p>
          </item>
        </list>
        <p>The runtime system normally refuses to load a driver if the major
          versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and the
          minor version used by the driver is greater than the one used
          by the runtime system. Old drivers with lower major versions
          are however allowed after a bump of the major version during
          a transition period of two major releases. Such old drivers can,
          however, fail if deprecated features are used.</p>
        <p>The emulator refuses to load a driver that does not use
          the extended driver interface, to allow for 64-bit capable drivers,
          as incompatible type changes for the callbacks
          <a href="driver_entry.html#output" class="seealso"><code>output</code></a>,
          <a href="driver_entry.html#control" class="seealso"><code>control</code></a>, and
          <a href="driver_entry.html#call" class="seealso"><code>call</code></a>
          were introduced in Erlang/OTP R15B. A driver written
          with the old types would compile with warnings and when
          called return garbage sizes to the emulator, causing it
          to read random memory and create huge incorrect result blobs.</p>
        <p>Therefore it is not enough to only recompile drivers written with
          version management for pre R15B types; the types must be changed
          in the driver suggesting other rewrites, especially regarding size
          variables. <em>Investigate all warnings when recompiling.</em></p>
        <p>Also, the API driver functions <code>driver_output*</code> and
          <code>driver_vec_to_buf</code>, <code>driver_alloc/realloc*</code>, and the
          <code>driver_*</code> queue functions were changed to have
          larger length arguments and return values. This is a
          lesser problem, as code that passes smaller types
          gets them auto-converted in the calls, and as long as
          the driver does not handle sizes that overflow an <code>int</code>,
          all will work as before.</p>

    <h4>Rewrites for 64-Bit Driver Interface</h4>
    <p>ERTS 5.9 introduced two new integer types,
      <a href="#ErlDrvSizeT" class="seealso"><code>ErlDrvSizeT</code></a> and
      <a href="#ErlDrvSSizeT" class="seealso"><code>ErlDrvSSizeT</code></a>,
      which can hold 64-bit sizes if necessary.</p>

    <p>To not update a driver and only recompile, it probably works
      when building for a 32-bit machine creating a false sense of security.
      Hopefully that will generate many important warnings.
      But when recompiling the same driver later on for a 64-bit machine,
      there <em>will</em> be warnings and almost certainly crashes.
      So it is a <em>bad</em> idea to postpone updating the driver and
      not fixing the warnings.</p>

    <p>When recompiling with <code>gcc</code>, use flag <code>-Wstrict-prototypes</code>

    <p>The following is a checklist for rewriting a pre ERTS 5.9 driver,
      most important first:</p>

    <taglist>
      <dt>Return types for driver callbacks</dt>
      <item>
	<p>Rewrite driver callback
	  <a href="driver_entry.html#control" class="seealso"><code>control</code></a>
	  to use return type <code>ErlDrvSSizeT</code> instead of <code>int</code>.</p>
	<p>Rewrite driver callback
	  <a href="driver_entry.html#call" class="seealso"><code>call</code></a>
	  to use return type <code>ErlDrvSSizeT</code> instead of <code>int</code>.</p>
	<div class="note"><h2>Note!</h2>
	  <p>These changes are essential not to crash the emulator
	    or worse cause malfunction.
	    Without them a driver can return garbage in the high 32 bits
	    to the emulator, causing it to build a huge result from random
	    bytes, either crashing on memory allocation or succeeding with
	    a random result from the driver call.</p>
	</div>
      </item>
      <dt>Arguments to driver callbacks</dt>
      <item>
	<p>Driver callback
	  <a href="driver_entry.html#output" class="seealso"><code>output</code></a>
	  now gets <code>ErlDrvSizeT</code> as 3rd argument instead
	  of previously <code>int</code>.</p>
	<p>Driver callback
	  <a href="driver_entry.html#control" class="seealso"><code>control</code></a>
	  now gets <code>ErlDrvSizeT</code> as 4th and 6th arguments instead
	  of previously <code>int</code>.</p>
	<p>Driver callback
	  <a href="driver_entry.html#call" class="seealso"><code>call</code></a>
	  now gets <code>ErlDrvSizeT</code> as 4th and 6th arguments instead
	  of previously <code>int</code>.</p>
	<p>Sane compiler's calling conventions probably make these changes
	  necessary only for a driver to handle data chunks that require
	  64-bit size fields (mostly larger than 2 GB, as that is what
	  an <code>int</code> of 32 bits can hold). But it is possible to think
	  of non-sane calling conventions that would make the driver
	  callbacks mix up the arguments causing malfunction.</p>
	<div class="note"><h2>Note!</h2>
	  <p>The argument type change is from signed to unsigned. This
	    can cause problems for, for example, loop termination conditions or

	<p>Automatic type-casting probably makes these changes necessary only
	  for a driver that encounters sizes &gt; 32 bits.</p>

        <p>The <code>ErlDrvBinary</code> structure is a binary, as sent
          between the emulator and the driver. All binaries are
          reference counted; when <code>driver_binary_free</code> is called,
          the reference count is decremented, when it reaches zero,
          the binary is deallocated. <code>orig_size</code> is the binary size
          and <code>orig_bytes</code> is the buffer.
          <code>ErlDrvBinary</code> has not a fixed size, its size is
          <code>orig_size + 2 * sizeof(int)</code>.</p>
        <div class="note"><h2>Note!</h2>
          <p>The <code>refc</code> field has been removed. The reference count of

        <p>Some driver calls, such as <code>driver_enq_binary</code>,
          increment the driver reference count, and others, such as
          <code>driver_deq</code> decrement it.</p>
        <p>Using a driver binary instead of a normal buffer is often
          faster, as the emulator needs not to copy the data,
          only the pointer is used.</p>
        <p>A driver binary allocated in the driver, with
          <code>driver_alloc_binary</code>, is to be freed in the driver
          (unless otherwise stated)
          with <code>driver_free_binary</code>. (Notice that this does not
          necessarily deallocate it, if the driver is still referred
          in the emulator, the ref-count will not go to zero.)</p>
        <p>Driver binaries are used in the <code>driver_output2</code> and
          <code>driver_outputv</code> calls, and in the queue. Also the
          driver callback <a href="driver_entry.html#outputv" class="seealso">
          <code>outputv</code></a> uses driver binaries.</p>
        <p>If the driver for some reason wants to keep a
          driver binary around, for example in a static variable, the
          reference count is to be incremented, and the binary can later
          be freed in the <a href="driver_entry.html#stop" class="seealso">
          <code>stop</code></a> callback, with <code>driver_free_binary</code>.</p>
        <p>Notice that as a driver binary is shared by the driver and
          the emulator. A binary received from the emulator or sent to
          the emulator must not be changed by the driver.</p>
        <p>Since ERTS 5.5 (Erlang/OTP R11B), <code>orig_bytes</code> is

        <p>If certain port-specific data must be accessed from other
          threads than those calling the driver callbacks, a port data lock
          can be used to synchronize the operations on the data.
          Currently, the only port-specific data that the emulator
          associates with the port data lock is the driver queue.</p>
        <p>Normally a driver instance has no port data lock. If
          the driver instance wants to use a port data lock, it must
          create the port data lock by calling
          <a href="#driver_pdl_create" class="seealso">
          <code>driver_pdl_create</code></a>.</p>
        <div class="note"><h2>Note!</h2>
          <p>Once the port data lock has been created, every
            access to data associated with the port data lock must be done
            while the port data lock is locked. The port data lock is
            locked and unlocked by
            <a href="#driver_pdl_lock" class="seealso">
            <code>driver_pdl_lock</code></a>, and

            <code>driver_pdl_unlock</code></a>, respectively.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A port data lock is reference counted, and when the reference
          count reaches zero, it is destroyed. The emulator at
          least increments the reference count once when the lock is
          created and decrements it once the port associated with
          the lock terminates. The emulator also increments the
          reference count when an async job is enqueued and decrements
          it when an async job has been invoked.
          Also, the driver is responsible for ensuring that
          the reference count does not reach zero before the last use
          of the lock by the driver has been made. The reference count
          can be read, incremented, and decremented by

        <span id="driver_async"> </span>
        <p>Performs an asynchronous call. The function
          <code>async_invoke</code> is invoked in a thread separate from the
          emulator thread. This enables the driver to perform
          time-consuming, blocking operations without blocking the
          emulator.</p>
        <p>The async thread pool size can be set with command-line argument
          <a href="erl.html#async_thread_pool_size" class="seealso"><code>+A</code></a>
          in <a href="erl.html" class="seealso"><code>erl(1)</code></a>.
          If an async thread pool is unavailable, the call is made
          synchronously in the thread calling <code>driver_async</code>. The
          current number of async threads in the async thread pool can be
          retrieved through <a href="#driver_system_info" class="seealso">
          <code>driver_system_info</code></a>.</p>
        <p>If a thread pool is available, a thread is used.
          If argument <code>key</code> is <code>NULL</code>, the threads from the
          pool are used in a round-robin way, each call to
          <code>driver_async</code> uses the next thread in the pool. With
          argument <code>key</code> set, this behavior is changed. The two
          same values of <code>*key</code> always get the same thread.</p>
        <p>To ensure that a driver instance always uses the same
          thread, the following call can be used:</p>
        <pre class="sh_erlang">
unsigned int myKey = driver_async_port_key(myPort);

r = driver_async(myPort, &myKey, myData, myFunc);    </pre>
        <p>It is enough to initialize <code>myKey</code> once for each
          driver instance.</p>
        <p>If a thread is already working, the calls are
          queued up and executed in order. Using the same thread for
          each driver instance ensures that the calls are made in sequence.</p>
        <p>The <code>async_data</code> is the argument to the functions
          <code>async_invoke</code> and <code>async_free</code>. It is typically a
          pointer to a structure containing a pipe or event that
          can be used to signal that the async operation completed.
          The data is to be freed in <code>async_free</code>.</p>
        <p>When the async operation is done,
          <a href="driver_entry.html#ready_async" class="seealso">
          <code>ready_async</code></a> driver
          entry function is called. If <code>ready_async</code> is <code>NULL</code> in
          the driver entry, the <code>async_free</code> function is called
          instead.</p>
        <p>The return value is <code>-1</code> if the <code>driver_async</code> call
          fails.</p>
        <div class="note"><h2>Note!</h2>
          <p>As from ERTS 5.5.4.3 the default stack size for
            threads in the async-thread pool is 16 kilowords,
            that is, 64 kilobyte on 32-bit architectures.
            This small default size has been chosen because the
            amount of async-threads can be quite large. The
            default stack size is enough for drivers delivered
            with Erlang/OTP, but is possibly not sufficiently large
            for other dynamically linked-in drivers that use the
            <code>driver_async</code> functionality. A suggested stack size
            for threads in the async-thread pool can be configured
            through command-line argument

          <p>Before Erlang/OTP R16, the port ID could be used as a key
            with proper casting, but after the rewrite of the port

            can achieve the same distribution based on port IDs as before

        <span id="driver_select"> </span>
        <p>This function is used by drivers to provide the emulator with
          events to check for. This enables the emulator to call the driver
          when something has occurred asynchronously.</p>
        <p>Parameter <code>event</code> identifies an OS-specific event object.
          On Unix systems, the functions <code>select</code>/<code>poll</code> are used.
          The event object must be a socket or pipe (or other object that
          <code>select</code>/<code>poll</code> can use).
          On Windows, the Win32 API function <code>WaitForMultipleObjects</code>
          is used. This places other restrictions on the event object;
          see the Win32 SDK documentation.</p>
        <p>Parameter <code>on</code> is to be <code>1</code> for setting events
          and <code>0</code> for clearing them.</p>
        <p>Parameter <code>mode</code> is a bitwise OR combination of
          <code>ERL_DRV_READ</code>, <code>ERL_DRV_WRITE</code>, and <code>ERL_DRV_USE</code>.
          The first two specify whether to wait for read events and/or write
          events. A fired read event calls
          <a href="driver_entry.html#ready_input" class="seealso">
          <code>ready_input</code></a> and a fired write event calls
          <a href="driver_entry.html#ready_output" class="seealso">
          <code>ready_output</code></a>.</p>
        <div class="note"><h2>Note!</h2>
          <p>Some OS (Windows) do not differentiate between read and write
            events. The callback for a fired event then only depends on the
            value of <code>mode</code>.</p>
        </div>
        <p><code>ERL_DRV_USE</code> specifies if we are using the event object or
          if we want to close it.
          On an emulator with SMP support, it is not safe to clear all events
          and then close the event object after <code>driver_select</code> has
          returned. Another thread can still be using the event object
          internally. To safely close an event object, call
          <code>driver_select</code> with <code>ERL_DRV_USE</code> and <code>on==0</code>, which
          clears all events and then either calls
	  <a href="driver_entry.html#stop_select" class="seealso"><code>stop_select</code></a>
	  or schedules it to be called when it is safe to close the event
          object. <code>ERL_DRV_USE</code> is to be set together with the first event
          for an event object. It is harmless to set <code>ERL_DRV_USE</code>
          even if it already has been done. Clearing all events but keeping
          <code>ERL_DRV_USE</code> set indicates that we are using the event
          object and probably will set events for it again.</p>
        <div class="note"><h2>Note!</h2>
          <p><code>ERL_DRV_USE</code> was added in Erlang/OTP R13. Old drivers still
            work as before, but it is recommended to update them to use
            <code>ERL_DRV_USE</code> and <code>stop_select</code> to ensure that event
            objects are closed in a safe way.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The return value is <code>0</code>, unless
          <code>ready_input</code>/<code>ready_output</code> is <code>NULL</code>, in which case

        <p>Sets and gets limits that will be used for controlling the

        <p>The port message queue is set into a busy
          state when the amount of command data queued on the
          message queue reaches the <code>high</code> limit. The port
          message queue is set into a not busy state when the
          amount of command data queued on the message queue falls
          below the <code>low</code> limit. Command data is in this
          context data passed to the port using either
          <code>Port ! {Owner, {command, Data}}</code> or
          <code>port_command/[2,3]</code>. Notice that these limits
          only concerns command data that have not yet reached the
          port. The <a href="#set_busy_port" class="seealso">busy port</a>
          feature can be used for data that has reached the port.</p>
        <p>Valid limits are values in the range
          <code>[ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_LIM_MIN, ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_LIM_MAX]</code>.
          Limits are automatically adjusted to be sane. That is,
          the system adjusts values so that the low limit used is
          lower than or equal to the high limit used. By default the high
          limit is 8 kB and the low limit is 4 kB.</p>
        <p>By passing a pointer to an integer variable containing
          the value <code>ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_READ_ONLY</code>, the currently used
          limit is read and written back to the integer variable.
          A new limit can be set by passing a pointer to an integer
          variable containing a valid limit. The passed value is
          written to the internal limit. The internal limit is then
          adjusted. After this the adjusted limit is written
          back to the integer variable from which the new value was
          read. Values are in bytes.</p>
        <p>The busy message queue feature can be disabled either
          by setting the <code>ERL_DRV_FLAG_NO_BUSY_MSGQ</code>
          <a href="driver_entry.html#driver_flags" class="seealso">driver flag</a>
          in the <a href="driver_entry.html" class="seealso"><code>driver_entry</code></a>
          used by the driver, or by calling this function with
          <code>ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_DISABLED</code> as a limit (either low or
          high). When this feature has been disabled, it cannot be
          enabled again. When reading the limits, both are
          <code>ERL_DRV_BUSY_MSGQ_DISABLED</code> if this
          feature has been disabled.</p>
        <p>Processes sending command data to the port are suspended
          if either the port is busy or if the port message queue is
          busy. Suspended processes are resumed when neither the

        </taglist>
        <p>The time is specified as a fraction, in percent, of a full time-slice
          that a port is allowed to execute before it is to surrender the
          CPU to other runnable ports or processes. Valid range is
          <code>[1, 100]</code>. The scheduling time-slice is not an exact entity,
          but can usually be approximated to about 1 millisecond.</p>
        <p>Notice that it is up to the runtime system to determine if and
          how to use this information. Implementations on some platforms
          can use other means to determine the consumed fraction
          of the time-slice. Lengthy driver callbacks should, regardless of
          this, frequently call this function to determine if it is allowed
          to continue execution or not.</p>
        <p>This function returns a non-zero value
          if the time-slice has been exhausted, and zero if the callback is
          allowed to continue execution. If a non-zero value is
          returned, the driver callback is to return as soon as possible in
          order for the port to be able to yield.</p>
        <p>This function is provided to better support co-operative scheduling,
          improve system responsiveness, and to make it easier to prevent
          misbehaviors of the VM because of a port monopolizing a scheduler
          thread. It can be used when dividing lengthy work into some repeated
          driver callback calls, without the need to use threads.</p>

        <p>The <code>ERL_DRV_STRING_CONS</code> term is a way to construct
          strings. It works differently from how <code>ERL_DRV_STRING</code>
          works. <code>ERL_DRV_STRING_CONS</code> builds a string list in
          reverse order (as opposed to how <code>ERL_DRV_LIST</code>
          works), concatenating the strings added to a list. The tail
          must be specified before <code>ERL_DRV_STRING_CONS</code>.</p>
        <p><code>ERL_DRV_STRING</code> constructs a string, and ends
          it. (So it is the same as <code>ERL_DRV_NIL</code> followed by
          <code>ERL_DRV_STRING_CONS</code>.)</p>

          However, if the content of the binary to pass already resides in
