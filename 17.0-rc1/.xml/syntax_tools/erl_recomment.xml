<p>Inserting comments into abstract Erlang syntax trees</p>
 
  <p>This module contains functions for inserting comments, described
  by position, indentation and text, as attachments on an abstract
  syntax tree, at the correct places.</p></description>
<funcs>
<func>
<name>quick_recomment_forms(Tree::Forms, Comments::[Comment]) -&gt; syntaxTree()</name>
<fsummary>Like recomment_forms/2, but only inserts top-level
  comments.</fsummary>
<type>
<v>Forms = syntaxTree() | [syntaxTree()]</v><v>Comment = {Line, Column, Indentation, Text}</v><v>Line = integer()</v><v>Column = integer()</v><v>Indentation = integer()</v><v>Text = [string()]</v></type>

<p>Like <seealso marker="#recomment_forms-2">recomment_forms/2</seealso>, but only inserts top-level
  comments. Comments within function definitions or declarations
  ("forms") are simply ignored.</p>
</desc></func>
<func>
<name>recomment_forms(Tree::Forms, Comments::[Comment]) -&gt; syntaxTree()</name>
<fsummary>Attaches comments to the syntax tree/trees representing a
  program.</fsummary>
<type>
<v>syntaxTree() (see module erl_syntax)</v><v>Forms = syntaxTree() | [syntaxTree()]</v><v>Comment = {Line, Column, Indentation, Text}</v><v>Line = integer()</v><v>Column = integer()</v><v>Indentation = integer()</v><v>Text = [string()]</v></type>
<desc><marker id="recomment_forms-2"/>

<p>Attaches comments to the syntax tree/trees representing a
  program. The given <c>Forms</c> should be a single syntax tree
  of type <c>form_list</c>, or a list of syntax trees
  representing "program forms". The syntax trees must contain valid
  position information (for details, see
  <c>recomment_tree/2</c>). The result is a corresponding syntax
  tree of type <c>form_list</c> in which all comments in the list
  <c>Comments</c> have been attached at the proper places.</p>
 
  <p>Assuming <c>Forms</c> represents a program (or any sequence
  of "program forms"), any comments whose first lines are not directly
  associated with a specific program form will become standalone
  comments inserted between the neighbouring program forms.
  Furthermore, comments whose column position is less than or equal to
  one will not be attached to a program form that begins at a
  conflicting line number (this can happen with preprocessor-generated
  <c>line</c>-attributes).</p>
 
  <p>If <c>Forms</c> is a syntax tree of some other type than
  <c>form_list</c>, the comments will be inserted directly using
  <c>recomment_tree/2</c>, and any comments left over from that
  process are added as postcomments on the result.</p>
 
  <p>Entries in <c>Comments</c> represent multi-line comments.
  For each entry, <c>Line</c> is the line number and
  <c>Column</c> the left column of the comment (the column of the
  first comment-introducing "<c>%</c>" character).
  <c>Indentation</c> is the number of character positions between
  the last non-whitespace character before the comment (or the left
  margin) and the left column of the comment. <c>Text</c> is a
  list of strings representing the consecutive comment lines in
  top-down order, where each string contains all characters following
  (but not including) the comment-introducing "<c>%</c>" and up
  to (but not including) the terminating newline. (Cf. module
  <c>erl_comment_scan</c>.)</p>
 
  <p>Evaluation exits with reason <c>{bad_position, Pos}</c> if
  the associated position information <c>Pos</c> of some subtree
  in the input does not have a recognizable format, or with reason
  <c>{bad_tree, L, C}</c> if insertion of a comment at line
  <c>L</c>, column <c>C</c>, fails because the tree
  structure is ill-formed.</p>

<func>
<name>recomment_tree(Tree::syntaxTree(), Comments::[Comment]) -&gt; {syntaxTree(), [Comment]}</name>
<fsummary>Attaches comments to a syntax tree.</fsummary>
<type>
<v>Comment = {Line, Column, Indentation, Text}</v><v>Line = integer()</v><v>Column = integer()</v><v>Indentation = integer()</v><v>Text = [string()]</v></type>

<p>Attaches comments to a syntax tree. The result is a pair
  <c>{NewTree, Remainder}</c> where <c>NewTree</c> is the
  given <c>Tree</c> where comments from the list
  <c>Comments</c> have been attached at the proper places.
  <c>Remainder</c> is the list of entries in
  <c>Comments</c> which have not been inserted, because their
  line numbers are greater than those of any node in the tree. The
  entries in <c>Comments</c> are inserted in order; if two  
comments become attached to the same node, they will appear in the  
same order in the program text.</p>
 
  <p>The nodes of the syntax tree must contain valid position
  information. This can be single integers, assumed to represent a line
  number, or 2- or 3-tuples where the first or second element is an
  integer, in which case the leftmost integer element is assumed to
  represent the line number. Line numbers less than one are ignored
  (usually, the default line number for newly created nodes is
  zero).</p>
 
  <p>For details on the <c>Line</c>, <c>Column</c> and
  <c>Indentation</c> fields, and the behaviour in case of errors,
  see <c>recomment_forms/2</c>.</p>
