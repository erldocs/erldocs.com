  <h2 class="modsummary">A Cross Reference Tool for analyzing dependencies between functions, modules, applications and releases.</h2>
  <div class="description">
    <p>Xref is a cross reference tool that can be used for finding
      dependencies between functions, modules, applications and
      releases.
      </p>
    <p>Calls between functions are either       <span id="local_call"> </span>
<em>local calls</em> like <code>f()</code>, or       <span id="external_call"> </span>
<em>external calls</em> like
      <code>m:f()</code>.       <span id="module_data"> </span>
<em>Module data</em>,
      which are extracted from BEAM files, include local functions,
      exported functions, local calls and external calls. By default,
      calls to built-in functions (BIF) are ignored, but
      if the option <code>builtins</code>, accepted by some of this
      module's functions, is set to <code>true</code>, calls to BIFs
      are included as well. It is the analyzing OTP version that
      decides what functions are BIFs. Functional objects are assumed
      to be called where they are created (and nowhere else).       <span id="unresolved_call"> </span>
<em>Unresolved calls</em> are calls to
      <code>apply</code> or <code>spawn</code> with variable module, variable
      function, or variable arguments. Examples are <code>M:F(a)</code>,
      <code>apply(M,&nbsp;f,&nbsp;[a])</code>, and
      <code>spawn(m,&nbsp;f(),&nbsp;Args)</code>. Unresolved calls are
      represented by calls where variable modules have been replaced
      with the atom <code>'$M_EXPR'</code>, variable functions have been
      replaced with the atom <code>'$F_EXPR'</code>, and variable number of
      arguments have been replaced with the number <code>-1</code>. The
      above mentioned examples are represented by calls to
      <code>'$M_EXPR':'$F_EXPR'/1</code>, <code>'$M_EXPR':f/1</code>, and
      <code>m:'$F_EXPR'/-1</code>. The unresolved calls are a subset of the
      external calls.
      </p>
    <div class="warning"><h2>Warning!</h2>
      <p>Unresolved calls make module data incomplete, which
        implies that the results of analyses may be invalid.</p>
    </div>
    <p><em>Applications</em> are collections of modules. The
      modules' BEAM files are located in the <code>ebin</code>
      subdirectory of the application directory. The name of the
      application directory determines the name and version of the
      application.
      <em>Releases</em> are collections of applications
      located in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the release directory. 
      There is more to read about applications and releases in the
      Design Principles book.
      </p>
    <p>      <span id="xref_server"> </span>
<em>Xref servers</em> are identified
      by names, supplied when creating new servers. Each Xref server
      holds a set of releases, a set of applications, and a set of
      modules with module data. Xref servers are independent of each
      other, and all analyses are evaluated in the context of one
      single Xref server (exceptions are the functions <code>m/1</code> and
      <code>d/1</code> which do not use servers at all). The       <span id="mode"> </span>
<em>mode</em> of an Xref server determines what module
      data are extracted from BEAM files as modules are added to the
      server. Starting with R7, BEAM files compiled with the option
      <code>debug_info</code> contain so called       <span id="debug_info"> </span>
debug information, which is an abstract
      representation of the code. In <code>functions</code> mode, which is
      the default mode, function calls and line numbers are extracted
      from debug information. In <code>modules</code> mode, debug
      information is ignored if present, but dependencies between
      modules are extracted from other parts of the BEAM files. The
      <code>modules</code> mode is significantly less time and space
      consuming than the <code>functions</code> mode, but the analyses that
      can be done are limited.
      </p>
    <p>An       <span id="analyzed_module"> </span>
<em>analyzed module</em> is a
      module that has been added to an Xref server together with its
      module data.
      A       <span id="library_module"> </span>
<em>library module</em> is a
      module located in some directory mentioned in the       <span id="library_path"> </span>
<em>library path</em>. 
      A library module is said to be used if some of its exported
      functions are used by some analyzed module.
      An       <span id="unknown_module"> </span>
<em>unknown module</em> is a
      module that is neither an analyzed module nor a library module,
      but whose exported functions are used by some analyzed module. 
      An       <span id="unknown_function"> </span>
<em>unknown function</em> is a
      used function that is neither local or exported by any 
      analyzed module nor exported by any library module. 
      An       <span id="undefined_function"> </span>
<em>undefined function</em> is an externally used function that
      is not exported by any analyzed module or library module. With
      this notion, a local function can be an undefined function, namely
      if it is externally used from some module. All unknown functions
      are also undefined functions; there is a <a href="xref_chapter.html#venn2" class="seealso">figure</a> in the
      User's Guide that illustrates this relationship.
      </p>
    <p>Starting with R9C, the module attribute tag <code>deprecated</code>
      can be used to inform Xref about       <span id="deprecated_function"> </span>
<em>deprecated functions</em> and
      optionally when functions are planned to be removed. A few
      examples show the idea:
      </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>-deprecated({f,1}).</dt>
      <dd>The exported function <code>f/1</code> is deprecated. Nothing is
       said whether <code>f/1</code> will be removed or not.</dd>
      <dt>-deprecated({f,'_'}).</dt>
      <dd>All exported functions <code>f/0</code>, <code>f/1</code> and so on are
       deprecated.</dd>
      <dt>-deprecated(module).</dt>
      <dd>All exported functions in the module are deprecated.
       Equivalent to <code>-deprecated({'_','_'}).</code>.</dd>
      <dt>-deprecated([{g,1,next_version}]).</dt>
      <dd>The function <code>g/1</code> is deprecated and will be
       removed in next version.</dd>
      <dt>-deprecated([{g,2,next_major_release}]).</dt>
      <dd>The function <code>g/2</code> is deprecated and will be
       removed in next major release.</dd>
      <dt>-deprecated([{g,3,eventually}]).</dt>
      <dd>The function <code>g/3</code> is deprecated and will
       eventually be removed.</dd>
      <dt>-deprecated({'_','_',eventually}).</dt>
      <dd>All exported functions in the module are deprecated and
       will eventually be removed.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Before any analysis can take place, module data must be <em>set up</em>. For instance, the cross reference and the unknown
      functions are computed when all module data are known. The
      functions that need complete data (<code>analyze</code>, <code>q</code>,
      <code>variables</code>) take care of setting up data automatically.
      Module data need to be set up (again) after calls to any of the
      <code>add</code>, <code>replace</code>, <code>remove</code>,
      <code>set_library_path</code> or <code>update</code> functions.
      </p>
    <p>The result of setting up module data is the       <span id="call_graph"> </span>
<em>Call Graph</em>. A (directed) graph
      consists of a set of vertices and a set of (directed) edges. The
      edges represent       <span id="call"> </span>
<em>calls</em> (From,&nbsp;To)
      between functions, modules, applications or releases. From is
      said to call To, and To is said to be used by From. The vertices
      of the Call Graph are the functions of all module data: local
      and exported functions of analyzed modules; used BIFs; used
      exported functions of library modules; and unknown functions.
      The functions <code>module_info/0,1</code> added by the compiler are
      included among the exported functions, but only when called from
      some module. The edges are the function calls of all module
      data. A consequence of the edges being a set is that there is
      only one edge if a function is locally or externally used
      several times on one and the same line of code.
      </p>
    <p>The Call Graph is       <span id="representation"> </span>
represented by
      Erlang terms (the sets are lists), which is suitable for many
      analyses. But for analyses that look at chains of calls, a list
      representation is much too
      slow. Instead the representation offered by the <code>digraph</code>
      module is used. The translation of the list representation of
      the Call Graph - or a subgraph thereof - to the <code>digraph</code>
      representation does not
      come for free, so the language used for expressing queries to be
      described below has a special operator for this task and a
      possibility to save the <code>digraph</code> representation for
      subsequent analyses.
      </p>
    <p>In addition to the Call Graph there is a graph called the
            <span id="inter_call_graph"> </span>
<em>Inter Call Graph</em>. This is
      a graph of calls (From,&nbsp;To) such that there is a chain of
      calls from From to To in the Call Graph, and every From and To
      is an exported function or an unused local function.
      The vertices are the same as for the Call Graph.
      </p>
    <p>Calls between modules, applications and releases are also
      directed graphs. The       <span id="type"> </span>
<em>types</em>
      of the vertices and edges of these graphs are (ranging from the
      most special to the most general):
      <code>Fun</code> for functions; <code>Mod</code> for modules;
      <code>App</code> for applications; and <code>Rel</code> for releases.
      The following paragraphs will describe the different constructs
      of the language used for selecting and analyzing parts of the
      graphs, beginning with the       <span id="constants"> </span>
<em>constants</em>:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expression ::= Constants</li>
      <li>Constants ::= Consts | Consts <code>:</code> Type | RegExpr</li>
      <li>Consts ::= Constant | <code>[</code>Constant<code>,</code>&nbsp;...<code>]</code>
       | <code>{</code>Constant<code>,</code>&nbsp;...<code>}</code></li>
      <li>Constant ::= Call | Const</li>
      <li>Call ::= FunSpec&nbsp;<code>-&gt;</code>&nbsp;FunSpec
       | <code>{</code>MFA<code>,</code>&nbsp;MFA<code>}</code>
       | AtomConst&nbsp;<code>-&gt;</code>&nbsp;AtomConst 
       | <code>{</code>AtomConst<code>,</code>&nbsp;AtomConst<code>}</code></li>
      <li>Const ::= AtomConst | FunSpec | MFA</li>
      <li>AtomConst ::= Application | Module | Release</li>
      <li>FunSpec ::= Module <code>:</code> Function <code>/</code> Arity</li>
      <li>MFA ::=
      <code>{</code>Module<code>,</code>&nbsp;Function<code>,</code>&nbsp;Arity<code>}</code></li>
      <li>RegExpr ::= RegString <code>:</code> Type 
       | RegFunc 
       | RegFunc <code>:</code> Type</li>
      <li>RegFunc ::= RegModule <code>:</code> RegFunction <code>/</code> RegArity</li>
      <li>RegModule ::= RegAtom</li>
      <li>RegFunction ::= RegAtom</li>
      <li>RegArity ::= RegString | Number | <code>_</code> | <code>-1</code></li>
      <li>RegAtom ::= RegString | Atom | <code>_</code></li>
      <li>RegString ::= - a regular expression, as described in the 
      <code>re</code> module, enclosed in double quotes -</li>
      <li>Type ::= <code>Fun</code> | <code>Mod</code> | <code>App</code> | <code>Rel</code></li>
      <li>Function ::= Atom</li>
      <li>Application ::= Atom</li>
      <li>Module ::= Atom</li>
      <li>Release ::= Atom</li>
      <li>Arity ::= Number | <code>-1</code></li>
      <li>Atom ::= - same as Erlang atoms -</li>
      <li>Number ::= - same as non-negative Erlang integers -</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of constants are: <code>kernel</code>, <code>kernel-&gt;stdlib</code>,
      <code>[kernel, sasl]</code>, <code>[pg -&gt; mnesia, {tv, mnesia}] : Mod</code>.
      It is an error if an instance of <code>Const</code> does not match any
      vertex of any graph. 
      If there  are more than one vertex matching an untyped instance
      of <code>AtomConst</code>, then the one of the most general type is
      chosen.
      A list of constants is interpreted as a set of constants, all of
      the same type.
      A tuple of constants constitute a chain of calls (which may,
      but does not have to, correspond to an actual chain of calls of
      some graph).
      Assigning a type to a list or tuple of <code>Constant</code> is
      equivalent to assigning the type to each <code>Constant</code>.
      </p>
    <p><span id="regexp"> </span><em>Regular expressions</em> are used as a
      means to select some of the vertices of a graph.
      A <code>RegExpr</code> consisting of a <code>RegString</code> and a type -
      an example is <code>"xref_.*" : Mod</code> - is interpreted as those
      modules (or applications or releases, depending on the type)
      that match the expression.
      Similarly, a <code>RegFunc</code> is interpreted as those vertices
      of the Call Graph that match the expression. 
      An example is <code>"xref_.*":"add_.*"/"(2|3)"</code>, which matches
      all <code>add</code> functions of arity two or three of any of the
      xref modules.
      Another example, one that matches all functions of arity 10 or
      more: <code>_:_/"[1-9].+"</code>. Here <code>_</code> is an abbreviation for
      <code>".*"</code>, that is, the regular expression that matches
      anything.
      </p>
    <p>The syntax of       <span id="variable"> </span>
<em>variables</em> is
      simple:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expression ::= Variable</li>
      <li>Variable ::= - same as Erlang variables -</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are two kinds of variables: predefined variables and user 
      variables. 
            <span id="predefined_variable"> </span>
<em>Predefined variables</em>
      hold set up module data, and cannot be assigned to but only used 
      in queries. 
            <span id="user_variable"> </span>
<em>User variables</em> on the other 
      hand can be assigned to, and are typically used for
      temporary results while evaluating a query, and for keeping
      results of queries for use in subsequent queries.

    </ul>
    <p>An important notion is that of       <span id="conversion"> </span>
<em>conversion</em> of expressions. The syntax of
      a cast expression is:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expression ::= <code>(</code> Type <code>)</code> Expression</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The interpretation of the cast operator depends on the named
      type <code>Type</code>, the type of <code>Expression</code>, and the
      structure of the elements of the interpretation of <code>Expression</code>. 
      If the named type is equal to the
      expression type, no conversion is done. Otherwise, the
      conversion is done one step at a time;
      <code>(Fun)&nbsp;(App)&nbsp;RE</code>, for instance, is equivalent to
      <code>(Fun)&nbsp;(Mod)&nbsp;(App)&nbsp;RE</code>. Now assume that the
      interpretation of <code>Expression</code> is a set of constants
      (functions, modules, applications or releases). If the named
      type is more general than the expression type, say <code>Mod</code>
      and <code>Fun</code> respectively, then the interpretation of the cast
      expression is the set of modules that have at least one
      of their functions mentioned in the interpretation of the
      expression. If the named
      type is more special than the expression type, say <code>Fun</code>
      and <code>Mod</code>, then the interpretation is the set of all the
      functions of the modules (in <code>modules</code> mode, the conversion
      is partial since the local functions are not known).
      The conversions to and from applications and releases
      work analogously. For instance, <code>(App) "xref_.*" : Mod</code>
      returns all applications containing at least one module
      such that <code>xref_</code> is a prefix of the module name.
      </p>
    <p>Now assume that the interpretation of <code>Expression</code> is a
      set of calls. If the named type is more general than the
      expression type, say <code>Mod</code> and <code>Fun</code> respectively,
      then the interpretation of the cast expression is the set of
      calls (M1,&nbsp;M2) such that the interpretation of the 
      expression contains a call from some function
      of M1 to some function of M2. If the named type is more special
      than the expression type, say <code>Fun</code> and <code>Mod</code>, then
      the interpretation is the set of all function calls
      (F1,&nbsp;F2) such that the interpretation of the expression
      contains a call (M1,&nbsp;M2) and F1 is
      a function of M1 and F2 is a function of M2 (in <code>modules</code>
      mode, there are no functions calls, so a cast to <code>Fun</code>
      always yields an empty set). Again, the conversions to and from
      applications and releases work analogously.
      </p>
    <p>The interpretation of constants and variables are sets, and
      those sets can be used as the basis for forming new sets by the
      application of       <span id="set_operator"> </span>
<em>set operators</em>.
      The syntax:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expression ::= Expression BinarySetOp Expression</li>
      <li>BinarySetOp ::= <code>+</code> | <code>*</code> | <code>-</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><code>+</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> are interpreted as union,
      intersection and difference respectively: the union of two sets
      contains the elements of both sets; the intersection of two sets
      contains the elements common to both sets; and the difference of
      two sets contains the elements of the first set that are not
      members of the second set. The elements of the two sets must be
      of the same structure; for instance, a function call cannot be
      combined with a function. But if a cast operator can make the
      elements compatible, then the more general elements are
      converted to the less general element type. For instance,
      <code>M&nbsp;+&nbsp;F</code> is equivalent to
      <code>(Fun)&nbsp;M&nbsp;+&nbsp;F</code>, and <code>E&nbsp;-&nbsp;AE</code>
      is equivalent to <code>E&nbsp;-&nbsp;(Fun)&nbsp;AE</code>. One more
      example: <code>X * xref : Mod</code> is interpreted as the set of
      functions exported by the module <code>xref</code>; <code>xref : Mod</code>
      is converted to the more special type of <code>X</code> (<code>Fun</code>,
      that is) yielding all functions of <code>xref</code>, and the
      intersection with <code>X</code> (all functions exported by analyzed 
      modules and library modules) is interpreted as those functions
      that are exported by some module <em>and</em> functions of 
      <code>xref</code>. 
      </p>
    <p>There are also unary set operators:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expression ::= UnarySetOp Expression</li>
      <li>UnarySetOp ::= <code>domain</code> | <code>range</code> | <code>strict</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Recall that a call is a pair (From,&nbsp;To). <code>domain</code>
      applied to a set of calls is interpreted as the set of all
      vertices From, and <code>range</code> as the set of all vertices To.
      The interpretation of the <code>strict</code> operator is the operand
      with all calls on the form (A,&nbsp;A) removed. 
      </p>
    <p>The interpretation of the       <span id="restriction"> </span>
<em>restriction operators</em> is a 
      subset of the first operand, a set of calls. The second operand,
      a set of vertices, is converted to the type of the first operand.
      The syntax of the restriction operators:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expression ::= Expression RestrOp Expression</li>
      <li>RestrOp ::= <code>|</code></li>
      <li>RestrOp ::= <code>||</code></li>
      <li>RestrOp ::= <code>|||</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The interpretation in some detail for the three operators:
      </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>|</code></dt>
      <dd>The subset of calls from any of the vertices.</dd>
      <dt><code>||</code></dt>
      <dd>The subset of calls to any of the vertices.</dd>
      <dt><code>|||</code></dt>
      <dd>The subset of calls to and from any of the vertices.
       For all sets of calls <code>CS</code> and all sets of vertices
      <code>VS</code>, <code>CS&nbsp;|||&nbsp;VS&nbsp;</code> is equivalent to
      <code>CS&nbsp;|&nbsp;VS&nbsp;*&nbsp;CS&nbsp;||&nbsp;VS</code>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>      <span id="graph_analyses"> </span>
Two functions (modules,
      applications, releases) belong to the same strongly connected
      component if they call each other (in)directly. The
      interpretation of the <code>components</code> operator is the set of
      strongly connected components of a set of calls. The
      <code>condensation</code> of a set of calls is a new set of calls
      between the strongly connected components such that there is an
      edge between two components if there is some constant of the first
      component that calls some constant of the second component.
      </p>
    <p>The interpretation of the <code>of</code> operator is a chain of
      calls of the second operand (a set of calls) that passes throw
      all of the vertices of the first operand (a tuple of
      constants), in the given order. The second operand
      is converted to the type of the first operand.
      For instance, the <code>of</code> operator can be used for finding out
      whether a function calls another function indirectly, and the
      chain of calls demonstrates how. The syntax of the graph
      analyzing operators:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expression ::= Expression GraphOp Expression</li>
      <li>GraphOp ::= <code>components</code> | <code>condensation</code> | <code>of</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>As was mentioned before, the graph analyses operate on
      the <code>digraph</code> representation of graphs.
      By default, the <code>digraph</code> representation is created when
      needed (and deleted when no longer used), but it can also be
      created explicitly by use of the <code>closure</code> operator:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expression ::= ClosureOp Expression</li>
      <li>ClosureOp ::= <code>closure</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The interpretation of the <code>closure</code> operator is the
      transitive closure of the operand. 
      </p>
    <p>The restriction operators are defined for closures as well;
      <code>closure&nbsp;E&nbsp;|&nbsp;xref&nbsp;:&nbsp;Mod</code> is
      interpreted as the direct or indirect function calls from the
      <code>xref</code> module, while the interpretation of
      <code>E&nbsp;|&nbsp;xref&nbsp;:&nbsp;Mod</code> is the set of direct
      calls from <code>xref</code>. 
      If some graph is to be used in several graph analyses, it saves
      time to assign the <code>digraph</code> representation of the graph
      to a user variable, 
      and then make sure that every graph analysis operates on that
      variable instead of the list representation of the graph.
      </p>
    <p>The lines where functions are defined (more precisely: where
      the first clause begins) and the lines where functions are used
      are available in <code>functions</code> mode. The line numbers refer
      to the files where the functions are defined. This holds also for
      files included with the <code>-include</code> and <code>-include_lib</code>
      directives, which may result in functions defined apparently in
      the same line. The <em>line operators</em> are used for assigning
      line numbers to functions and for assigning sets of line numbers
      to function calls. 
      The syntax is similar to the one of the cast operator:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expression ::= <code>(</code> LineOp<code>)</code> Expression</li>
      <li>Expression ::= <code>(</code> XLineOp<code>)</code> Expression</li>
      <li>LineOp ::= <code>Lin</code> | <code>ELin</code> | <code>LLin</code> | <code>XLin</code></li>
      <li>XLineOp ::= <code>XXL</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The interpretation of the <code>Lin</code> operator applied to a set
      of functions assigns to each function the line number where the
      function is defined. Unknown functions and functions of library
      modules are assigned the number 0.
      </p>
    <p>The interpretation of some LineOp operator applied to a
      set of function calls assigns to each call the set of line
      numbers where the first function calls the second function. Not
      all calls are assigned line numbers by all operators:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the <code>Lin</code> operator is defined for Call Graph Edges;</li>
      <li>the <code>LLin</code> operator is defined for Local Calls.</li>
      <li>the <code>XLin</code> operator is defined for External Calls.</li>
      <li>the <code>ELin</code> operator is defined for Inter Call Graph Edges.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <code>Lin</code> (<code>LLin</code>, <code>XLin</code>) operator assigns
      the lines where calls (local calls, external calls) are made.
      The <code>ELin</code> operator assigns to each call (From,&nbsp;To),
      for which it is defined, every line L such that there is
      a chain of calls from From to To beginning with a call on line
      L.
      </p>
    <p>The <code>XXL</code> operator is defined for the interpretation of
      any of the LineOp operators applied to a set of function
      calls. The result is that of replacing the function call with
      a line numbered function call, that is, each of the two
      functions of the call is replaced by a pair of the function and
      the line where the function is defined. The effect of the
      <code>XXL</code> operator can be undone by the LineOp operators. For
      instance, <code>(Lin)&nbsp;(XXL)&nbsp;(Lin)&nbsp;E</code> is
      equivalent to <code>(Lin)&nbsp;E</code>.
      </p>
    <p>The <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>#</code> operators are
      defined for line number expressions, provided the operands are
      compatible. The LineOp operators are also defined for
      modules, applications, and releases; the operand is implicitly
      converted to functions. Similarly, the cast operator is defined
      for the interpretation of the LineOp operators.
      </p>
    <p>The interpretation of the       <span id="count"> </span>
<em>counting operator</em> is the number of elements of a set. The operator
      is undefined for closures. The <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> and <code>*</code>
      operators are interpreted as the obvious arithmetical operators
      when applied to numbers. The syntax of the counting operator:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expression ::= CountOp Expression</li>
      <li>CountOp ::= <code>#</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>All binary operators are left associative; for instance,
      <code>A&nbsp;|&nbsp;B &nbsp;||&nbsp;C</code> is equivalent to
      <code>(A&nbsp;|&nbsp;B)&nbsp;||&nbsp;C</code>. The following is a list
      of all operators, in increasing order of       <span id="precedence"> </span>
<em>precedence</em>:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>+</code>, <code>-</code></li>
      <li><code>*</code></li>
      <li><code>#</code></li>
      <li><code>|</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>|||</code></li>
      <li><code>of</code></li>
      <li><code>(</code>Type<code>)</code></li>
      <li><code>closure</code>, <code>components</code>, <code>condensation</code>,
      <code>domain</code>, <code>range</code>, <code>strict</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Parentheses are used for grouping, either to make an expression
      more readable or to override the default precedence of operators:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expression ::= <code>(</code> Expression <code>)</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>A       <span id="query"> </span>
<em>query</em> is a non-empty sequence of
      statements. A statement is either an assignment of a user
      variable or an expression. The value of an assignment is the
      value of the right hand side expression. It makes no sense to
      put a plain expression anywhere else but last in queries. The
      syntax of queries is summarized by these productions:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Query ::= Statement<code>,</code>&nbsp;...</li>
      <li>Statement ::= Assignment | Expression</li>
      <li>Assignment ::= Variable <code>:=</code> Expression 
       | Variable <code>=</code> Expression</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A variable cannot be assigned a new value unless first removed.
      Variables assigned to by the <code>=</code> operator are removed at
      the end of the query, while variables assigned to by the
      <code>:=</code> operator can only be removed by calls to
      <code>forget</code>. There are no user variables when module data
      need to be set up again; if any of the functions that make it
      necessary to set up module data again is called, all user
      variables are forgotten.
